        <h2>My personal interests</h2>
        <p>
            Music has always been a big part of my life. I've played the piano since I was
            very young, and right now I'm also practicing the drumset and vibraphone. I did
            marching band and concert band in high school, playing all sorts of percussion instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've also been playing video games since before even the piano. My favorites include
            Factorio, Deep Rock Galactic, and Terraria. I was also on the League of Legends
            Esports team at my high school for three years.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite outdoor activities are skiing, rock climbing, and biking. I've also
            been skiing since I was very young, and the best place to go is definitely Alta Ski
            Resort. My family all love to ski, and we've had a great time going this year.
